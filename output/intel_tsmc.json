However, industry insiders are dismissing this idea as ‘unrealistic.’ They point out that TSMC's advanced nodes, especially 3nm, are in such high demand that there's no need for the company to offer Intel, or any customer, a discount on what is essentially premium real estate in chip manufacturing.",

Not only is Apple utilizing these nodes, but Qualcomm, NVIDIA, and even Samsung have shown interest. In fact, competition is so fierce that Intel had to agree to pay a premium just to ensure timely access to TSMC’s 3nm nodes.",

Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, is reportedly planning a visit to Taiwan in November to meet with TSMC’s Chairman, Mark Liu, to discuss their future cooperation. The aim of this meeting could likely be to negotiate costs, secure TSMC’s capacity for Intel’s 3nm requirements, and potentially look ahead to TSMC’s upcoming 2nm process.",

Intel’s own internal manufacturing, especially its 20A and 18A nodes, has faced delays and yield issues. As a result, Intel has been forced to outsource a portion of its production to TSMC. Products like Intel’s upcoming Lunar Lake processors, which rely on TSMC’s N3B node, are pivotal for Intel to stay competitive in the high-performance computing market.",

For TSMC, Intel’s demand for 3nm manufacturing means they need to carefully manage capacity to avoid affecting their other high-profile clients like Apple, who are equally dependent on TSMC’s advanced nodes.",

Given this, any hopes Intel might have for a substantial discount seem far-fetched at best. Most of TSMC’s discounts are reserved for long-term partners who’ve been part of the development process for these advanced nodes, such as Apple.",
