This is a question that’s on the minds of tech enthusiasts, investors, and even the executives at Google themselves.",

Its revenue from search ads has been a cornerstone of its business, funding everything from autonomous vehicles to cloud services. But what happens when people find a new way to get the information they need? A way that doesn’t require traditional search engines or even the ads that keep them running.",

      "text": "Let’s start with what these AI search models actually do differently. Platforms like Perplexity and ChatGPT give users something Google can’t offer in quite the same way: direct, synthesized answers to complex questions. Imagine you want a summary of the latest research on climate change or need a quick tutorial on installing a new software. With traditional search engines, you’re presented with a long list of links, each of which you’d need to open, read, and sift through for the relevant information. AI models, on the other hand, pull together the information for you, offering a clear, concise answer within seconds.",

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "And that’s the key difference. Instead of clicking through multiple links and seeing various ads, you get a streamlined response from these AI models. Think about it: this kind of efficiency could drastically reduce the need for users to even visit multiple websites. And, with fewer clicks, Google’s primary source of revenue, search ads, could take a hit.",

      "duration": 22.176

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "Then there’s the conversational aspect of these AI models. Let’s say you asked an AI a question, but you want more details or have a follow-up. You can just ask again, and the AI will adjust its response based on your question history. This interactivity creates an almost personal relationship between the user and the AI, similar to chatting with a very knowledgeable assistant. Google is working on its own AI, like Bard, to respond to this trend, but for many users, this conversational experience with platforms like Perplexity and ChatGPT is already changing their habits.",

      "text": "Another point to consider is the lack of ads on these AI platforms. Imagine being able to get information without scrolling past ads or sponsored content. For users, this is a major advantage—no distractions, no interruptions, just pure information. But for Google, this represents a significant threat to their revenue model, which relies heavily on those very ads that people might now prefer to avoid.",

      "text": "And it doesn’t stop there. AI models are increasingly being integrated into applications and workflows outside of search engines. Think of a scenario where you’re working on a project management app, and you need information fast. Instead of opening a new tab and heading to Google, you could just ask an integrated AI assistant right within your app. This ease of access could further reduce the necessity of using traditional search engines altogether.",

      "text": "But what does Google do in response to all this? Well, Google isn’t sitting back. They’re investing heavily in AI technologies, developing their own language models, and even integrating AI into search. Their tool, Bard, is one example of this. They know they need to evolve to stay relevant. But here’s the challenge: shifting away from an ad-driven business model is no small feat. If AI starts to replace traditional search, Google would need to find new ways to monetize its services, potentially even in areas that don’t involve ads at all.",

Imagine a world where search ads aren’t the primary way to fund our access to information. Or where instead of navigating multiple sources, we engage directly with AI that curates the world’s knowledge for us. It’s an exciting, but also complex, evolution that we’ll be watching closely in the years to come.",
