If engines allowed us to transcend our physical limitations, AI could do the same for our intellectual capabilities—essentially multiplying brain power in ways that previous innovations never did.",

He imagines a world where AI could make basic goods and services so efficient and cheap to produce that scarcity essentially becomes obsolete. Imagine universal basic income, cheaper goods, and a society where working is an option, not a necessity. AI promises to create abundance, a future where work is driven by passion rather than survival.",

The shift will take time, and different timeframes—like the next 10, 25, or 50 years—will look very different. Khosla emphasizes that navigating this transition will require thoughtful policies, especially for those who are displaced by AI.",

Khosla argues that while these risks are real, they're also manageable. One of the most pressing risks is not AI going rogue, but rather losing the AI race to authoritarian countries like China, which could lead to truly dystopian outcomes.",

But Khosla sees a solution in smart interventions—such as income redistribution through universal basic income—to ensure that AI's wealth is shared more broadly. He believes that AI will generate enough value to make this possible, and that, over time, everyone could be better off in a world shaped by AI.",

Khosla argues that the biggest threat isn’t an AI overlord, but authoritarian regimes using AI to control and manipulate. If the West wants to ensure that AI is used ethically, it must stay ahead in the AI race.",
