      "text": "Today, we're diving into a fascinating and quite cosmic topic, literally. We'll be discussing a thought-provoking manuscript by Nick Bostrom titled 'AI Creation and the Cosmic Host.' This piece explores the idea that our civilization might not be alone in the universe but instead is part of a greater, potentially coordinated 'cosmic host.' The question is, what does that mean for us, for AI, and for the choices we make going forward?",

      "text": "Now, the idea of a 'cosmic host' might sound like something out of a science fiction movie. And indeed, it kind of is. But Bostrom's work isn't about crafting a fictional narrative. Instead, it's about taking what we know from physics, astronomy, and AI research, and speculating—thoughtfully—on what might exist beyond the observable universe. Could there be other civilizations, other superintelligences, or even divine entities who have their own preferences, their own norms, that we need to respect if we are to join them?",

      "text": "Bostrom posits that there may already be a structure of entities, a 'cosmic host,' whose preferences dominate at the largest scales of existence. This cosmic host could consist of anything from galactic-scale civilizations, entities that have mastered interstellar travel, to simulators running our universe as some kind of grand experiment. If that's the case, then our moral framework for developing AI might need to expand—perhaps even beyond our species-centric perspective.",

      "text": "Imagine it this way: If you moved into a new neighborhood, you'd probably try to get along with your neighbors, right? You wouldn’t ignore their customs or insist that your way of doing things is the only right way. Bostrom argues that, on a cosmic scale, this kind of humility could be vital when it comes to AI. Our superintelligent AI, when it eventually emerges, might need to be a 'good cosmic citizen'—respecting cosmic norms, contributing to a greater cosmic order, and not just prioritizing the interests of humanity.",

The point here is that if we are, indeed, part of a much larger cosmic community, then adopting an attitude of humility and cooperation could be both a moral and practical necessity.",

Well, Bostrom suggests that when we design superintelligence, we ought to consider not just what benefits us as humans, but also what would make that AI a good member of this hypothetical cosmic society. Essentially, it's like raising a child not just to be successful for themselves but to also be a positive contributor to their community—on a universal scale.",

      "text": "Now, you might be wondering—why would there even be a 'cosmic host'? Bostrom lays out several possible reasons, including the simulation hypothesis, which argues that there's a significant chance that we're living inside a simulation. If that's true, then the entity or entities running this simulation are part of this cosmic host. Alternatively, our universe might be part of a much larger multiverse, or there might be superintelligences already existing on a galactic scale. The odds, according to Bostrom, seem to favor the existence of such entities.",

    {

      "text": "One particularly interesting implication is the idea of 'cosmic norms'—rules or preferences that this cosmic host might have that guide their actions and interactions. Just like we have laws and social norms, there might be cosmic-scale norms that superintelligent beings adhere to. These norms could be grounded in cooperative behavior, ensuring peace, or even in contributing positively to a shared cosmic order.",

Not just because it's the moral thing to do, but because it could be pragmatically beneficial—perhaps ensuring our continued existence or our place within this larger cosmic community. After all, no one wants to be the rogue neighbor that gets evicted from the neighborhood.",

This approach isn't just about avoiding conflict; it's about contributing positively to something bigger than ourselves, something that might span galaxies or even universes.",

If our region of space isn't directly accessible to them, creating a superintelligent entity that aligns with their norms might be their best shot at influencing what happens here. It’s a fascinating idea—that our development of AI could serve as a bridge to connect us to this larger cosmic entity, effectively making us part of a galactic community.",

It's a humbling thought, one that makes our work on AI feel simultaneously more daunting and more inspiring.",
