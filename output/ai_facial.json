But with the latest technology from Israel-based Corsight AI, your interaction might be flagged as 'anomalous.' Why? Because facial recognition cameras are watching, tracking every move, and trying to determine whether you have a personal relationship with that cashier. If you consistently go to the same person, an alert might be triggered.",

That's when employees give discounts or freebies to people they know—family members, friends, or maybe even a sweetheart. According to Corsight's CEO, Shai Toren, their system can analyze how close customers stand to employees and track whether customers keep returning to the same cashier. Any anomaly detected in behavior triggers a notification for store security.",

But here's the twist: the data used to justify this technology is, at best, questionable. The National Retail Federation, which often releases statistics about retail theft, recently had to retract claims after it was found that they misinterpreted their own data. Still, Corsight's new system is being adopted by some retailers, although they aren't revealing who.",

Chelsea Connor, from the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, pointed out that this system makes unfair assumptions about customer loyalty. Many retail workers are encouraged to build strong relationships with customers—especially those working on commission. If you're good at building trust and connection, this technology might end up punishing you for it.",

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission recently banned Rite Aid from using facial recognition because it was found to be biased—falsely flagging certain groups, particularly women and people of color, as shoplifters. The potential for bias, discrimination, and wrongful targeting with these systems is a huge concern.",

In other words, while the stated goal is security, the technology could easily be used to monitor and analyze consumer behavior for profit—something that many customers might not even be aware of.",

On the other hand, there’s a very real risk of infringing on the privacy rights of both employees and customers. Do we really want to be surveilled at this level when we walk into a store? Is the potential reduction in theft worth the price we pay in terms of our personal privacy?",
