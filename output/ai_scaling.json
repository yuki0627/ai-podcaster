It's a shift that not only changes how we build software, but also how companies are defining their future, and even their very survival. I'm talking about the transition from the traditional craftsmanship of software engineering to the industrial revolution of artificial intelligence and superclusters.",

Aschenbrenner makes a bold prediction: by 2027, we could see the emergence of AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence. This is an AI that could theoretically perform any intellectual task a human can, and possibly more. But why does he think this could happen so soon? Well, it all comes down to something called 'scale'.",

      "text": "Let's start with a bit of context. Traditionally, software development has been more of an art than a science. Imagine the process of creating a painting—it's detailed, unique, and highly dependent on the skill of the artist. Software was similar in many ways. No matter how many engineers you hired or how much money you threw at a project, there were no guarantees you'd end up with something truly groundbreaking. In fact, some of the most successful software projects in history were small, tightly-focused efforts led by a few highly skilled people.",

Despite having tons of resources, Cairo ultimately failed, while Windows 95, which was more of a backup plan, succeeded wildly. Another classic case is Apple. Steve Jobs, after being pushed out of Apple, went on to create NeXT, a small team that eventually developed the foundation for what we now know as macOS and iOS. Even Linux started as a one-man project by Linus Torvalds, and it ended up revolutionizing the server world.",

      "text": "But now, we have something different—an entirely new paradigm for software development. Enter 'Software 2.0,' where instead of writing detailed rules, we let neural networks learn from data. And this is where scaling comes in. Unlike traditional software, AI benefits directly from increasing both the size of the neural network and the volume of training data. More parameters and more data almost always mean better performance. This concept, known as the 'scaling advantage,' is something completely unique to AI development.",

And it has created a new kind of race among tech giants—Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and even Tesla—all trying to build the most powerful AI systems by investing billions into what we call 'AI superclusters.' These are massive computer systems designed to train incredibly large AI models.",

      "text": "Why are these companies doing this? Well, it's not just about staying ahead; it's about survival. In the past, software giants competed through features, user experience, and sometimes sheer luck. But now, the ability to create and control advanced AI could determine whether a company stays at the forefront of technology or fades into irrelevance. This is an existential threat for many of these tech giants. If they lose this AI race, they lose their position as industry leaders.",

      "text": "It's fascinating to note that this is the first time in software history that scaling—just putting in more money, data, and computing—can lead directly to success. AI development has, in many ways, become an industrial process. It's like mass production for intelligence. If you have the resources, you can produce smarter and smarter systems. That's why the amount of money these companies are willing to spend is skyrocketing—from hundreds of millions to billions, and perhaps even hundreds of billions of dollars.",

      "text": "Interestingly, one company missing from this AI arms race is Apple. While Apple is focusing on smaller AI models that run on their devices, like the iPhone, they're not investing heavily in building AI superclusters or competing for AGI. Maybe it's because their current ecosystem is strong, or perhaps they simply don't see the same existential threat that others do. But as AGI continues to evolve, there's a real chance that wearables connected to AGI could eventually make smartphones obsolete. Only time will tell if Apple has made the right choice.",
