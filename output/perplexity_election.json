They have a track record of scraping content, even from behind paywalls, which has led to controversy and even legal issues. But this time, Perplexity decided to venture into the complex world of live election tracking with an Election Information Hub that promises voters reliable, real-time updates on issues and results.",

The Election Information Hub was built with real-time data sources, including partnerships with Democracy Works and the Associated Press, known for providing accurate election information. This was essential to prevent AI hallucinations—where models fill gaps by inventing details—which has been a persistent challenge in the field.",

      "text": "So why did Perplexity take this risk while other companies like OpenAI and Google held back? According to Wired, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Search and Google’s search engine both limited their AI responses on political topics. OpenAI even declined requests for candidate endorsements or recommendations. Google, on the other hand, explicitly limited AI’s involvement in election-related searches, recognizing that even small errors can create significant misinterpretations.",

He even posted a message on X, formerly Twitter, suggesting that Perplexity was the only AI capable of providing accurate election tracking. In a twist, Srinivas also made an offer to The New York Times during a labor strike, suggesting that Perplexity’s technology could provide ‘infrastructure’ support—not AI-generated content. This was a calculated move to gain visibility for Perplexity while highlighting its infrastructure capabilities.",

      "text": "While Perplexity’s tool didn’t make significant errors during its election tracking, this was largely due to its reduced reliance on AI-generated summaries, instead pulling from directly sourced information. This caution was necessary, as Perplexity is already facing scrutiny over its AI summarizing content from other publishers, with reports that it even ignores certain web-scraping restrictions. In fact, Wired reported that Perplexity is currently navigating legal issues from outlets like Forbes and News Corp for summarizing articles without permission and, at times, fabricating information or citing inaccurate sources.",

As Wired pointed out, using AI to summarize articles can result in unintended inaccuracies, especially without proper safeguards. Perplexity seems to be aware of these risks, but the question remains: can they navigate the fine line between innovation and intellectual property rights, especially in such a high-stakes arena as political information?",
