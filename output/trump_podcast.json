      "text": "Today, we’re diving into a topic that blends media, politics, and the power of authenticity in a digital age. We’ll be talking about how former President Donald Trump is using podcasts to reach audiences, in a way that traditional 'Legacy' media is just not able to do. This idea was sparked by a thought-provoking tweet by Farzad, and I think it’s a great lens to look at the evolving media landscape as we head into the next election cycle.",

      "text": "Now, let’s set the scene. The largest trend in media over the past decade has been the shift away from legacy outlets like TV news networks and major newspapers, towards newer, less filtered formats—like podcasts and social media. These platforms allow for more nuanced and often less polished conversations, something that many people are craving today. Farzad points out that there’s a significant portion of the public, often called the 'silent majority,' that feels underserved by traditional media, which is perceived as overly biased and sensationalist.",

      "text": "Trump, in his usual non-traditional fashion, is fully leaning into this trend. He’s been making appearances on major podcasts—think Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman, Flagrant, and Theo Von’s podcast. These long-form interviews give him a chance to show a side of himself that often gets lost in the sound bites and polished clips we see on TV. Instead of the rapid-fire Q&A we’re used to in the news, these podcasts allow Trump to be 'raw, unfiltered, and transparent.' And it’s this authenticity that seems to be resonating with a lot of people.",

      "text": "Farzad makes a compelling point about how traditional media, or legacy media as he calls it, is designed for guests to 'never say the wrong thing.' It's polished, it's safe, and ultimately, it's kind of fake. In contrast, podcasts are where the messy, complex, and sometimes uncomfortable conversations happen. It’s where guests can be contentious, explore difficult ideas, and really show their true selves. Trump is using this to his advantage. He’s allowing himself to be humanized in front of millions of listeners—many of whom may be seeing a side of him they’ve never seen before.",

      "text": "Think about it—legacy media wants to minimize controversy to avoid 'the wrong thing' going viral. But podcasts are thriving on those very moments of raw, spontaneous conversation. People are fed up with being spoon-fed polished narratives, and they want to hear something real, even if it’s imperfect or controversial. And that’s where Trump is getting the edge.",

She hasn’t gone on Joe Rogan, or done any of these big podcasts, and as a result, she risks being seen as part of that 'polished but fake' category. The implication here is that if you’re not willing to sit down and have an honest, open conversation in the way Trump is, you’re automatically perceived as less genuine—and that’s dangerous in today’s media landscape, where authenticity rules.",

He’s using these platforms to bridge the gap between the polished image we see in traditional media and the real person that he wants to present. Farzad even suggests that this could give Trump a 'massive advantage' that might not be visible until election day itself. We’re talking about millions of listeners in swing states, independents, and those who are just sick of the usual media coverage.",

He attributes this shift partly to Trump's podcast strategy, which could continue to widen that gap. It’s all about showing people something different from the status quo, and it seems to be working.",

They want authenticity, they want real conversations, and they want to hear from candidates in a setting that feels genuine. Whether you love or hate Trump, his use of podcasts is strategically brilliant in today’s media environment.",

It’s fascinating to think that the future of political campaigns could very well depend on something as seemingly casual as a podcast appearance.",
