This isn't just a minor trend; it's a recurring phenomenon in the IPO market, and there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.",

      "text": "For starters, let's define what we mean by 'leaving money on the table'. In the context of Initial Public Offerings, or IPOs, this phrase refers to the difference between the offer price of a company's stock and the closing price on its first day of trading. The bigger the difference, the more money was 'left on the table'. Imagine pricing your home at $200,000, only for it to be bought and resold the same day for $260,000. You'd be missing out on $60,000. That's what many companies do during IPOs.",

During this period, companies left more than $43 billion on the table. That's a mind-boggling figure, isn't it?",

      "text": "Prospect theory suggests that issuers tend to focus on the change in their wealth rather than the absolute value. In simple terms, if they see a big increase in their paper wealth on the first day of trading, that increase often outweighs the perceived 'loss' from the money left on the table. It’s as if they are integrating the good news and not worrying about what could have been.",

      "text": "And then, there's the role of the underwriters—the middlemen in this process. Underwriters, like real estate agents, get a percentage of the sales. They actually benefit from underpricing IPOs. Why? Because they can allocate those underpriced shares to their most profitable clients, such as hedge funds and institutional investors, who then reward the underwriters with future business and higher commissions. This arrangement, known as 'soft dollars', effectively misaligns the interests of underwriters with those of the companies going public.",

      "text": "Underwriters want a lower offer price because it makes marketing the IPO easier and helps keep their buy-side clients happy. For the company going public, however, this means less immediate capital and a lower valuation on day one—at least on paper. But many executives are satisfied with the IPO because they still see a significant increase in their company's valuation from pre-IPO expectations. It's almost like the thrill of seeing your stock price jump makes you forget how much more you could have had.",

This meant that $193 million was left on the table. The interesting thing is that Ceridian wasn't upset about it. In fact, they retained the same underwriters, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, for their follow-on offering later that year. It seems that despite leaving so much on the table, they were still happy with the results.",

The interests of underwriters and issuers are not always aligned, and underwriters have an incentive to keep offer prices low for their own benefit.",

In these methods, there's no room for underwriters to allocate underpriced shares to their favorite clients because there is no underpricing to begin with. Companies like Spotify and Slack have already used direct listings to avoid leaving money on the table, and it's likely that we'll see more of this in the future.",

While it seems irrational to leave so much money on the table, psychological factors, incentives for underwriters, and even traditional practices keep the system in place. But with growing awareness, we might see more companies looking to keep that money in their own pockets rather than handing it over to Wall Street.",
