But here’s where the magic happens: the device uses a blend of machine learning and traditional signal processing to dynamically and in real-time isolate and enhance the sound of your target. And all of this is done with an incredibly low latency—less than 10 milliseconds for audio processing and under 100 milliseconds for focus adjustments.",
