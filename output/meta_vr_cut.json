Specifically, how Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, is rethinking its approach to spending on apps and content for its Quest headsets. This news comes from a recent report by *The Information*, titled 'Meta’s VR App Funding Retreat Forces Developers to Slash Staff.'",

      "text": "Over the past few years, Meta has poured millions into developing apps and content to support its Quest headsets, part of its push into virtual and augmented reality, or what the company calls 'mixed reality.' However, it appears that Meta is becoming more selective with how it invests in apps for these platforms. With sales in the mixed reality space weakening, Meta is now focusing on specific genres that they believe will have broader appeal.",

According to the report, the company has closed one of its own internal VR studios and reduced funding for certain external app developers. This shift has led to significant changes for many studios and developers who were previously working on Meta's projects.",

Similarly, a Paris-based startup called Atlas V, which developed popular VR titles like 'Wallace & Gromit in The Grand Getaway,' also had to reduce its workforce significantly after Meta scaled back its funding for new projects.",

It’s clear that Meta is trying to make the hardware more accessible as a way to grow its user base, especially with the recent entrance of Apple into the mixed reality space with its high-end Vision Pro.",

The company is also doubling down on artificial intelligence, even as its Reality Labs division faces budget cuts and spending reductions for hardware development. Meta’s AI focus could suggest a pivot in their long-term vision—potentially toward experiences that extend beyond VR headsets.",

Several developers have mentioned that the changes in Meta’s funding priorities made it harder for smaller apps to get noticed, especially after Meta merged the Quest App Lab, which was meant for smaller, experimental apps, with the Quest Store, which hosts larger, high-profile games.",

This shift toward more discreet, wearable tech—smart glasses rather than headsets—could align with trends toward AI integration and more seamless user experiences. But for now, this strategy doesn’t create many opportunities for outside developers since Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses lack an app store or display function to support third-party content.",

Without quality content, there’s less incentive for consumers to buy and use VR devices. But on the other hand, Meta needs to ensure that the apps they fund have the potential for widespread appeal, especially as competition in the XR space grows more intense.",

Market trends show a decline in XR device sales overall, but mixed reality devices—those that blend the physical and digital worlds—have shown some growth. As companies like Meta, Apple, and others continue to evolve in this space, the path forward remains uncertain but certainly intriguing.",
