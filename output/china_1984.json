But moments later, you see your own face up on a massive LED screen, complete with your name, all to publicly shame you for breaking the rules. In this episode, we’re going to explore this phenomenon in detail.",

Chongqing alone has over 2.6 million cameras—that's nearly one camera for every six residents. This kind of technology, powered by AI, allows not just for constant surveillance, but also real-time shaming of those who step out of line.",

It’s a sort of technological social deterrent, meant to make people think twice before breaking the law. But this is just one part of a much larger story about how technology is used to monitor, control, and even score citizens on their behavior.",

Cameras and AI systems work together to track what citizens do, from how they cross the street to what they purchase. Your 'score' can determine if you can buy a plane ticket, rent a house, or even get a loan.",

This capability recently helped catch a man wanted for a 2002 murder. For law enforcement, it’s a powerful tool, but for ordinary citizens, it raises a lot of questions about rights and privacy.",
