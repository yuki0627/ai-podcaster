TSMC recently announced plans to increase the prices of its highly sought-after 3nm and CoWoS semiconductor processes starting in 2025. This news comes to us from a recent article on Wccftech, titled 'TSMC Expected To Bump Up 3nm & CoWoS Pricing Moving Into 2025 Amid Massive Market Demand & Supply Chain Bottlenecks.'",

Companies like NVIDIA and AMD, known for their AI solutions and high-performance computing, rely on TSMC’s 3nm technology and CoWoS, or Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate packaging, for their latest products. In fact, TSMC's products have become indispensable in the world of artificial intelligence, where demand is skyrocketing.",

      "text": "So, what’s driving this price increase? Well, it comes down to simple supply and demand. The market demand for advanced semiconductor processes—especially for AI—is enormous, and TSMC is feeling the pressure to meet that demand. The company’s production lines are almost completely booked for the coming year, making it challenging to keep up.",

      "text": "The planned price hikes will be fairly significant. According to Wccftech, TSMC’s 3nm process is expected to see a 5% increase, while CoWoS packaging may jump by as much as 10-20%. This is quite a move, considering how sensitive pricing can be in tech manufacturing. TSMC seems confident, however, and they've already received approval from some major clients, like NVIDIA, for these changes.",

      "text": "Now, TSMC has a unique position in the semiconductor industry. It’s no exaggeration to say they hold something close to a monopoly over advanced processes, particularly in AI. Their technology has become foundational to many industries, and with this price hike, we might see ripple effects throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain and beyond. And, if you’re wondering about how this affects TSMC’s financials, Morgan Stanley has projected that TSMC’s gross margins will soar as a result. So, this is likely to translate into strong earnings growth for them moving forward.",

      "text": "Interestingly, geopolitical factors also play a role in this story. Taiwan Government has recently imposed new restrictions on TSMC, forbidding the company from manufacturing its 2nm chips outside Taiwan. This is raising questions about TSMC’s ambitions to expand in the U.S., where they’re already building facilities. It’s also worth noting that the U.S. government has restricted TSMC from selling 7nm and more advanced nodes to Chinese firms due to concerns about national security and potentially aiding Huawei’s technological capabilities.",

Balancing domestic, client, and international pressures, TSMC is navigating both market and political challenges. On top of this, there’s also speculation that Huawei has been poaching TSMC engineers, reportedly offering salaries up to triple the usual rate, as Huawei seeks to advance its own semiconductor capabilities.",

The demand for advanced nodes like TSMC’s 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes shows no sign of slowing, especially as AI continues to expand across sectors. This price hike could shape the market by affecting production costs for companies relying on these chips, and it could influence global supply chains for years to come.",
