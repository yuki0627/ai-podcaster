In fact, Onagawa was one of the nuclear power plants that survived the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, though it came frighteningly close to disaster. It was truly a story of narrow margins. Let me set the scene: during the earthquake, the plant's ground level sank by about 1 meter. The incoming tsunami reached 13 meters, and the plant's height was just enough—leaving an 80-centimeter gap between safety and catastrophe."

Additionally, four out of the five external power lines were knocked out. A fire broke out in the basement of the turbine building for Reactor 1, and the roads were so damaged that fire engines couldn't get there in time. The fire had to be extinguished using portable extinguishers. It was a chaotic scene, to say the least."

      "text": "And yet, here we are in 2024, witnessing the reactivation of Reactor 2. Despite these alarming memories, the Japanese government and industry groups are moving forward with nuclear power, labeling it a 'carbon-neutral' solution to the growing energy needs. The move has certainly not been without criticism. Various anti-nuclear groups, including NGOs like FoE Japan, have raised questions about the adequacy of the current safety measures. They cite numerous unresolved issues, such as the unclear mechanisms behind hydrogen explosions, which were seen during the Fukushima Daiichi disaster."

      "text": "But the biggest question remains: can we truly ensure safety in such a seismically active region? Japan is an earthquake hotspot, and there's a very good reason why so many people are hesitant to embrace nuclear energy again. Even with multiple rounds of reviews and compliance with so-called safety standards, the risks never fully disappear—they are merely minimized. The article I'm referencing today, titled '地震の巣窟で女川原発再稼働' or 'Restarting Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant in an Earthquake Nest,' takes a hard look at these issues. You can find it at the link in our episode description."

      "text": "Let's talk about the government's approach to emergency planning. In theory, Japan's nuclear safety strategy follows the principle of 'defense in depth.' There are supposed to be five layers of protection, with the first four being technical and physical barriers inside the nuclear facility itself. The fifth layer is about protecting the public in the event of an emergency—evacuation plans, communication, shelters, and so forth. However, in Japan, the fifth layer seems to fall significantly short. There's a lot of talk about meetings and discussions, but not enough tangible action to make people feel secure. It's more about having a plan on paper than actually implementing effective solutions."

      "text": "For instance, during a recent review meeting, the government officials mentioned the need for 'indoor evacuation' for areas where immediate evacuation is not feasible. They also discussed coordinating with local authorities, ensuring proper transportation for those needing assistance, and incorporating pandemic measures into their response plans. However, the article suggests that these plans are inadequate—and frankly, insufficiently scrutinized. The region's geography, being on a peninsula with limited exit routes, makes the challenge even greater."

      "text": "So, what drives Japan's return to nuclear power? One reason is pressure from the nuclear industry. Groups like the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan and the Nuclear Energy Council have continuously lobbied for faster and more efficient reviews, seeing nuclear energy as a critical component of the country's green energy goals. With carbon neutrality becoming an urgent priority, nuclear power is seen by many as a necessary evil. However, the question is whether this path truly prioritizes the safety and well-being of the people."

      "text": "This brings us to the core of today's discussion: Is the push for nuclear energy in Japan, despite all the lessons learned from Fukushima, a step forward or a step backward? As a country so vulnerable to natural disasters, should Japan be pursuing alternatives that pose fewer catastrophic risks? Renewable energy, like wind and solar, while not without challenges, might offer a safer long-term solution."

      "text": "As we wrap up today's episode, I want to leave you with this thought: We often hear about technological advancements and innovation as a means to solve our problems. But when it comes to something as powerful and potentially dangerous as nuclear energy, the line between progress and peril can be razor-thin. It demands a level of caution and respect that goes beyond just meeting regulatory checklists. The Onagawa plant's reactivation is a sobering reminder of the risks we are willing to take in the name of progress."
