        "text": "The AI initiative is said to involve hundreds of people at Disney and will focus primarily on post-production and visual effects. Imagine that—Disney, a company already known for magic, stepping even deeper into the world of artificial intelligence to enhance what we see on screen. Not only that, but there's also word that this initiative could extend to Disney's parks and experiences, though not in a way that would directly impact customers... yet."

        "text": "To me, this is fascinating because it’s a perfect reflection of Disney’s history. Walt Disney himself was an early adopter of technology to tell stories better. From the introduction of synchronized sound in 'Steamboat Willie' to the use of groundbreaking CGI in 'Tron', Disney has always leaned into new technologies. And now, under the leadership of Bob Iger, it looks like they’re doing it again with AI."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "Bob Iger recently talked about AI as just another tool in the storyteller’s kit. During the Canva Create showcase in May, he reminded us that Walt Disney believed technology in the hands of a storyteller could be unbelievably powerful. He encouraged people not to focus on AI’s disruptive potential, but on how it could help tell better stories and reach more people. It’s hard not to get a little inspired by that perspective."

        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "But, as with any major technological shift, there’s a flip side. The use of AI in Hollywood is still a hot-button topic, especially given the recent push to unionize various visual effects departments. For those who’ve worked tirelessly on VFX for years, the rapid advancement of AI tools could feel like a threat. There’s also the fact that Disney laid off about 7,000 employees in 2023, and an expansion into AI could mean more restructuring and cuts in creative departments."

      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "This balance between creativity and technology is a theme we've been grappling with in all areas of entertainment and art. It’s not just about how cool the tech is—it’s also about how it affects the people behind the scenes. Disney’s move here could set a precedent for other major studios, especially as AI is increasingly used to speed up post-production or even create content that would otherwise require hours and hours of human effort."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "Take, for example, the use of AI in 'The Mandalorian' to bring a younger Luke Skywalker to life or in 'Elemental' to calculate the unique movement of Ember’s fire. Disney’s already been using AI in their productions, but this new initiative is a big leap—it's about making AI a central part of how they work, not just a neat trick in their bag of effects."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "And it’s not just about movies or series. As one of the most diversified entertainment companies, Disney has data on everything—from how we watch content on Disney+ to how people spend time at their theme parks. This data could be used in powerful ways to enhance experiences, personalize content, or even design entirely new forms of entertainment that we can't yet imagine."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "However, the creative community is understandably concerned. An imminent announcement of an AI partnership is bound to produce some backlash. There are real fears here—what does it mean for jobs? For creativity? For originality? I think these are important questions to ask, and they remind us that every technological advancement brings both opportunities and challenges."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "So, what do we take away from all this? On one hand, Disney’s move into AI is in line with their long history of innovation. On the other, it highlights the ongoing tension between technological progress and the human element in creativity. It’s going to be fascinating to see how this plays out—not just for Disney, but for the entire entertainment industry."
