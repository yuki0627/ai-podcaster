      "text": "Today, we’re diving into one of the most controversial topics in the tech policy world: net neutrality. This debate has been ongoing for years, with strong opinions on both sides. The latest updates come from an article on The Verge titled 'FCC and the broadband industry argue net neutrality’s future,' written by Lauren Feiner, a senior policy reporter covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill."

      "text": "So, what’s happening now with net neutrality? Well, just recently, attorneys representing the FCC and various groups in the broadband industry presented their arguments to a panel of judges from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. This was more than just a routine court appearance. It’s part of an endless legal back-and-forth over whether internet service providers, or ISPs, should be classified as 'common carriers' under Title II regulations. This classification would prevent ISPs from selectively slowing down or throttling certain types of web traffic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "To give you some context, net neutrality rules were initially put in place during the Obama administration. But then, under President Trump, these rules were repealed, only to be reinstated under President Biden's FCC this past April. But, just as quickly as these rules were put back in place, they were put on hold by the Sixth Circuit Court while this current case unfolds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "During the recent hearing, the judges questioned the arguments from both sides. It was clear that the crux of the debate revolves around the FCC’s authority to enforce these rules, especially after two Supreme Court rulings that have limited the powers of federal regulatory agencies. Specifically, these cases have brought more attention to the 'major questions' doctrine, which basically says that Congress must clearly authorize agencies to make significant policy decisions. In addition, there’s the end of something called Chevron deference — a doctrine that previously directed judges to defer to agency expertise when laws were ambiguous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "Now, without Chevron deference, the courts have more leeway to interpret whether policies like net neutrality should be enforced. This makes it harder for the FCC to implement and enforce these rules, which is exactly what the broadband industry is arguing. Jeffrey Wall, representing the industry, described the FCC’s actions as a potential power grab, arguing that if allowed, the FCC might start to control a range of ISP activities — from the types of plans they offer to the costs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "On the other side, the FCC's attorney, Jacob Lewis, argued that Congress has always intended for the FCC to make these types of classifications under the Communications Act. He emphasized that while different FCC administrations have taken varying stances on net neutrality, it’s ultimately within the agency’s power to determine how to classify internet services under Title II."

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "The decision is now up to the Sixth Circuit judges, but regardless of the outcome, the losing side will likely appeal. This could even bring the issue back to the Supreme Court. And the timing here is interesting — depending on who wins the upcoming presidential election, the future of net neutrality could shift yet again. Remember, it was a change in administration that led to the repeal of net neutrality under Trump’s FCC, and the reinstatement under Biden’s FCC."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "So, what’s at stake? If the FCC succeeds, ISPs could be held to strict regulations, ensuring equal access to web traffic and preventing them from favoring certain websites or services. But if the broadband industry prevails, it could set a precedent limiting the FCC’s ability to enforce net neutrality — and possibly any future regulatory action over internet services."

    {
      "speaker": "Host",
      "text": "As technology and our dependence on the internet continue to evolve, so too will the conversation around net neutrality. It’s a complex issue with far-reaching implications, not just for big companies and regulators but for all of us who rely on fair and open access to information."
