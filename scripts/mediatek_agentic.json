        "text": "Today, we're diving into an exciting new concept that’s been making waves in the tech world—'agentic' AI. Now, if you've been following the news around flagship mobile chips, you might have heard of MediaTek’s latest release: the Dimensity 9400. This chip isn’t just about speed and power; it’s designed to take our AI assistants to the next level."

        "text": "So, what does 'agentic' AI actually mean? Essentially, it refers to AI agents—imagine multiple AI models working together, seamlessly, to complete complex tasks. With this new Dimensity chip, MediaTek is aiming to make AI assistants more capable of crossing app boundaries and taking actions on your behalf. Picture this: You tell your AI assistant to call your mom and wish her a happy birthday. Instead of just making the call, your phone's AI creates a personalized birthday message, finds your mom's number, and even makes the call with an AI-generated voice."

        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "This is the kind of future that MediaTek is pushing with its new Dimensity 9400—technology that doesn’t just respond to you but actively handles tasks across different apps. The chip includes a 'Dimensity Agentic AI Engine' to help developers build these advanced AI systems. MediaTek claims it can support around 50 tokens per second for AI computation, which is quite an upgrade compared to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which supports about 20 tokens per second."

        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "The idea of 'agentic' AI is something we’re going to be hearing a lot more about, especially as we head into 2025. The real question, though, is how well this technology will actually work in real life. So far, we've seen AI models that are powerful enough to handle complex tasks, but often, they need the cloud to do most of the heavy lifting. This new on-device AI aims to change that by offering a more autonomous assistant that can work offline—without making, let's say, awkward mistakes like wishing someone the wrong thing!"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "There’s also a bit of a challenge here: how can we make sure that these AI assistants can integrate smoothly across all apps, all while respecting our privacy and preferences? The possibilities are incredibly exciting, but there are still plenty of hurdles to overcome. And MediaTek isn’t alone—other companies, like Google with Gemini and Apple with its upcoming AI overhaul, are racing to build the most seamless assistant experiences possible."

      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "So, whether you're an Android fan or an Apple user, the truth is, the future is agentic. These assistants will be more proactive, more personalized, and yes, potentially even more intrusive. It’s an exciting and somewhat daunting future to think about, isn’t it? Imagine the kind of agency your phone could have—not just in helping you, but in almost thinking for you. It’s like we're on the cusp of turning our phones from mere devices into full-on personal assistants that understand and act on our behalf."

      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "Let me know what you think about this. Would you trust an AI assistant to call your loved ones on your behalf? Is this the kind of technology you’d embrace with open arms, or does it make you a little uneasy? Feel free to share your thoughts on our socials or drop us a voice note—I'd love to hear from you."
