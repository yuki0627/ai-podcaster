This is a story of strategic investments, bold ambitions, and perhaps even some regret. We'll look at how SoftBank's initial investment in NVIDIA marked a new chapter in the AI revolution, and how, after parting ways, both companies have continued to make waves in the technology world."

SoftBank, led by its visionary founder Masayoshi Son, made a big move by purchasing a 4.9% stake in NVIDIA, a company that was already making headlines for its innovations in GPU technology. At the time, SoftBank’s Vision Fund had a mission to support groundbreaking technology companies, and NVIDIA fit the bill perfectly."

        "text": "NVIDIA was known for its high-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, which initially transformed gaming but were quickly gaining importance in fields like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and data centers. SoftBank's investment was not only financially strategic but also symbolically significant. It sent a strong signal that SoftBank saw a future where AI would play a critical role, and NVIDIA’s GPUs would be at the heart of it."

        "text": "For about two years, this relationship flourished. NVIDIA’s stock value was steadily climbing, and the tech world was becoming increasingly aware of the company’s central role in the AI revolution. But in 2019, SoftBank made a surprising decision: they sold their entire stake in NVIDIA, cashing out with a profit of around $3.3 billion."

        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "Now, why did SoftBank sell NVIDIA stock that early? The answer is multi-layered. One factor was portfolio rebalancing. SoftBank’s Vision Fund wasn’t just focused on AI and semiconductors; it invested in a broad range of tech companies. By selling NVIDIA shares, they freed up capital to explore other ventures. Another reason was market conditions. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, had some volatility in 2018 due to fluctuations in demand, especially as the cryptocurrency mining boom cooled off. NVIDIA's growth slowed temporarily, and for some investors, that signaled a good time to exit."

      {
        "speaker": "Host",
        "text": "Additionally, SoftBank was heavily invested in other emerging technologies and companies, and selling NVIDIA allowed them to reinvest that capital into newer, high-potential ventures, staying true to Masayoshi Son’s dynamic investment approach. But as NVIDIA's value soared in the years that followed, Masayoshi Son publicly admitted that selling NVIDIA was a missed opportunity. In hindsight, holding onto those shares would have been tremendously profitable, as demand for NVIDIA's GPUs has skyrocketed, especially with the rise of generative AI and large language models."

        "text": "Then came 2020, when NVIDIA and SoftBank's paths crossed again in a big way. NVIDIA announced a bold plan to acquire Arm, a UK-based semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank, for $40 billion. The proposed deal aimed to blend NVIDIA’s AI expertise with Arm’s widely adopted CPU technology. It would have been a powerful combination, uniting AI and mobile computing to accelerate innovation across devices. However, regulatory bodies around the world raised antitrust concerns. After almost two years of scrutiny, the deal fell through in 2022."

        "text": "Fast forward to 2023. SoftBank and NVIDIA announced a collaboration that marked a new era of cooperation. This time, they focused on generative AI and advanced communication technologies like 5G and 6G. By deploying NVIDIA’s cutting-edge GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip in Japan, SoftBank aims to power data centers that support AI-driven wireless networks. This project is a testament to how these companies continue to lead in AI and communications, each in their own domain."

        "text": "So, where does this story leave us? SoftBank and NVIDIA have certainly had a complex and evolving relationship. From strategic investments and attempted acquisitions to cutting-edge collaborations, both companies have grown in their own ways. For SoftBank, NVIDIA remains the one that got away—a missed chance to ride the AI wave to an even larger financial gain. For NVIDIA, SoftBank was a key investor that helped fuel its early AI-driven growth."

        "text": "In October 2024, Masayoshi Son publicly stated that he believes NVIDIA’s stock is still undervalued, reflecting his unshaken belief in NVIDIA’s potential to drive the AI future. He sees AI as a transformative force, one that will only continue to grow in importance. Who knows—maybe we’ll see these two giants working even closer together in the future."
